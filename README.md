## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

**LeagueUnlocked is designed to be completely transparent - just launch it and forget about it!**

1. **Launch LeagueUnlocked** (from desktop shortcut or start menu)
2. **Accept the UAC prompt** (Administrator privileges required for injection)
3. **Let it run in the background** - you don't need to interact with it
4. **Play League of Legends normally** - the app works silently in the background
5. **That's it!** LeagueUnlocked handles everything automatically

### 🔐 Administrator Rights & Auto-Start

**LeagueUnlocked requires Administrator privileges** to inject skins into League of Legends.

#### First Launch

- **UAC Prompt**: On first launch, Windows will ask for administrator permission
- **One-Time**: Click "Yes" to allow the app to run with admin rights
- **Automatic**: The app will then restart with proper privileges

#### Auto-Start (Recommended)

**Enable seamless auto-start to avoid UAC prompts on every launch:**

1. Launch LeagueUnlocked (accept the initial UAC prompt)
2. Right-click the LeagueUnlocked icon in the system tray
3. Click **"Enable Auto-Start"**
4. Done! The app will now:
   - Start automatically when you log into Windows
   - Run with administrator privileges
   - **No UAC prompts** on startup

**Benefits:**

- ✅ No more UAC prompts on every launch
- ✅ Starts automatically with Windows
- ✅ Runs silently in the background
- ✅ Works across computer restarts

**To disable auto-start:**

- Right-click the tray icon → "Remove Auto-Start"

For detailed information, see **[ADMIN_RIGHTS.md](ADMIN_RIGHTS.md)**

The application runs in the system tray and requires no user interaction. Simply play League of Legends as usual, and when you hover over skins in champion select, the app will automatically detect and inject them.

### How It Works Behind the Scenes

While you play, LeagueUnlocked operates through a sophisticated multi-threaded system:

1. **Phase Detection**: Monitors League Client for game phases (lobby, champion select, in-game)
2. **OCR Activation**: Automatically activates OCR when entering champion select
3. **Champion Lock Detection**: Detects when you lock a champion and fetches your owned skins from LCU
4. **Real-Time Skin Detection**: Uses advanced OCR to detect skin names as you hover over them during champion select
5. **Ownership Verification**: Automatically skips injection if you already own the detected skin
6. **Base Skin Forcing**: Forces base skin selection before injection (required for proper skin overlay)
7. **Automatic Injection**: Injects the last hovered unowned skin 500 milliseconds before game starts with CPU priority boost for reliability

**Performance & Reliability**:

- **Process Suspension**: Game process is suspended during injection to ensure reliable overlay installation
- **High-Priority Processing**: Uses CPU priority boost for mkoverlay and runoverlay processes
- **Safety Mechanisms**: 20-second auto-resume timeout prevents game from being stuck frozen
- **Smart Injection**: Only injects skins you don't own, verified against LCU inventory
- **Robust Fallbacks**: Multiple LCU endpoints ensure base skin forcing works reliably

**No manual intervention required - just launch the app and play!**

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Unified Game Monitor System

LeagueUnlocked uses a **single, unified monitor** for game process management, eliminating race conditions and complexity:

**Monitor Lifecycle:**

1. **Start**: Monitor activates when injection begins
2. **Watch**: Continuously scans for `League of Legends.exe` process
3. **Suspend**: Immediately suspends game when found to freeze loading
4. **Hold**: Keeps game suspended during mkoverlay (skin preparation)
5. **Resume**: Releases game when runoverlay starts (allows game to load while overlay hooks in)
6. **Safety**: Auto-resumes after 20s if injection stalls (prevents permanent freeze)

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **No Race Conditions**: Single source of truth for game state
- ✅ **Reliable Timing**: Ensures injection completes before game finishes loading
- ✅ **Fail-Safe**: Multiple safety mechanisms prevent game from being stuck

### In-Memory State Management

All application state is stored in memory using a thread-safe `SharedState` dataclass:

- **Zero File I/O**: No reading/writing state files during operation
- **Faster Performance**: Eliminates disk access overhead
- **Thread-Safe**: Lock-protected shared state across 6 concurrent threads
- **Clean Architecture**: Centralized state management in `state/shared_state.py`

### Multi-Threaded Architecture

LeagueUnlocked uses 6 specialized threads for optimal performance:

1. **Phase Thread**: Monitors LCU for game phase changes (lobby → champ select → in-game)
2. **Champion Thread**: Detects champion hover/lock and fetches owned skins from LCU
3. **OCR Thread**: High-frequency skin name detection using EasyOCR with optimized preprocessing
4. **WebSocket Thread**: Real-time event handling via LCU WebSocket connection
5. **LCU Monitor Thread**: Maintains connection to League Client
6. **Loadout Ticker Thread**: Countdown timer for injection timing

All threads coordinate through the shared state system for seamless operation.
