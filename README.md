# SkinCloner

**League of Legends Skin Changer with Advanced OCR Detection**

SkinCloner is a fully automated system that detects skin selections in League of Legends champion select using advanced OCR technology and automatically injects custom skins 3 seconds before the game starts. Built with a modular architecture and multi-language support, it provides a seamless experience for League of Legends players.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Tesseract OCR Installation

**SkinCloner requires Tesseract OCR to function properly. This is a mandatory dependency that must be installed before using the application.**

#### Download and Installation

1. **Download Tesseract OCR for Windows:**

   - Visit: **[https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/releases](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/releases)**
   - Download the latest Windows installer (e.g., `tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.x.x.exe`)

2. **Install Tesseract OCR:**

   - Run the installer **as Administrator**
   - **IMPORTANT**: During installation, select "Additional language data" to install language packs
   - Use the default installation path: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\`

3. **Optional - Add to System PATH** (Recommended):

   ```powershell
   # Add Tesseract to PATH (run as Administrator)
   $env:PATH += ";C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR"
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $env:PATH, [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
   ```

4. **Verify Installation:**

   ```bash
   # Check if Tesseract is accessible
   tesseract --version

   # Check available languages
   tesseract --list-langs
   ```

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Installer Version (Recommended for Users)

**For users who want a simple, ready-to-use application:**

1. **Download the latest installer** from [releases](https://github.com/AlbanCliquet/SkinCloner/releases/latest)
2. **Run** `SkinCloner_Setup.exe` **as Administrator**
3. **Follow the setup wizard** - the installer will create shortcuts and configure the application
4. **Launch the app** from your desktop or start menu

**System Requirements:**

- Windows 10/11
- League of Legends installed
- Tesseract OCR installed (see Prerequisites)

### Option 2: Source Code Version (For Developers)

**For developers and advanced users who want to modify the code:**

1. **Install Python 3.11**
2. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlbanCliquet/SkinCloner.git
   cd SkinCloner
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This automatically installs the local tesserocr wheel from the `dependencies/` folder.

4. **Verify installation** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python utils/check_tesseract.py
   ```

**System Requirements:**

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.11
- Tesseract OCR installed (see Prerequisites)
- League of Legends installed
- CSLOL tools present in `injection/tools/` directory

## 🌍 Supported Languages

SkinCloner supports all languages that use the Latin alphabet, including:

- **English** (eng) - **Spanish** (spa) - **French** (fra) - **German** (deu)
- **Italian** (ita) - **Portuguese** (por) - **Polish** (pol) - **Turkish** (tur)
- **Hungarian** (hun) - **Romanian** (ron) - And other Latin-based languages

The system automatically detects your League of Legends client language.

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

**SkinCloner is designed to be completely transparent - just launch it and forget about it!**

1. **Launch SkinCloner** (from desktop shortcut or start menu)
2. **Let it run in the background** - you don't need to interact with it
3. **Play League of Legends normally** - the app works silently in the background
4. **That's it!** SkinCloner handles everything automatically

The application runs in the system tray and requires no user interaction. Simply play League of Legends as usual, and when you hover over skins in champion select, the app will automatically detect and inject them.

### How It Works Behind the Scenes

While you play, SkinCloner operates through a sophisticated multi-threaded system:

1. **Phase Detection**: Monitors League Client for game phases (lobby, champion select, in-game)
2. **OCR Activation**: Automatically activates OCR when entering champion select
3. **Champion Lock Detection**: Detects when you lock a champion and fetches your owned skins from LCU
4. **Smart Pre-Building**: Pre-builds overlay files **only for unowned skins** of your locked champion in parallel (optimized based on your inventory)
5. **Real-Time Skin Detection**: Uses advanced OCR to detect skin names as you hover over them during champion select
6. **Ownership Verification**: Automatically skips injection if you already own the detected skin
7. **Base Skin Forcing**: Forces base skin selection before injection (required for proper skin overlay)
8. **Instant Injection**: Injects the last hovered unowned skin 500 milliseconds before game starts using pre-built overlays (<100 milliseconds injection time)

**Performance**: Pre-building allows near-instant skin injection instead of the traditional 2 second wait. The system intelligently filters owned skins to reduce pre-build time and only injects skins you don't own.

**No manual intervention required - just launch the app and play!**
