# SkinCloner

**League of Legends Skin Changer with Advanced OCR Detection**

SkinCloner is a fully automated system that detects skin selections in League of Legends champion select using advanced OCR technology and automatically injects custom skins 500 milliseconds before the game starts. Built with a modular architecture, unified game process monitoring, and multi-language support, it provides a seamless experience for League of Legends players.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Tesseract OCR Installation

**SkinCloner requires Tesseract OCR to function properly. This is a mandatory dependency that must be installed before using the application.**

#### Download and Installation

1. **Download Tesseract OCR for Windows:**

   - Visit: **[https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/releases](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/releases)**
   - Download the latest Windows installer (e.g., `tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.x.x.exe`)

2. **Install Tesseract OCR:**

   - Run the installer **as Administrator**
   - **IMPORTANT**: During installation, select "Additional language data" to install language packs
   - Use the default installation path: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\`

3. **Optional - Add to System PATH** (Recommended):

   ```powershell
   # Add Tesseract to PATH (run as Administrator)
   $env:PATH += ";C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR"
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $env:PATH, [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
   ```

4. **Verify Installation:**

   ```bash
   # Check if Tesseract is accessible
   tesseract --version

   # Check available languages
   tesseract --list-langs
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

**SkinCloner is designed to be completely transparent - just launch it and forget about it!**

1. **Launch SkinCloner** (from desktop shortcut or start menu)
2. **Let it run in the background** - you don't need to interact with it
3. **Play League of Legends normally** - the app works silently in the background
4. **That's it!** SkinCloner handles everything automatically

The application runs in the system tray and requires no user interaction. Simply play League of Legends as usual, and when you hover over skins in champion select, the app will automatically detect and inject them.

### How It Works Behind the Scenes

While you play, SkinCloner operates through a sophisticated multi-threaded system:

1. **Phase Detection**: Monitors League Client for game phases (lobby, champion select, in-game)
2. **OCR Activation**: Automatically activates OCR when entering champion select
3. **Champion Lock Detection**: Detects when you lock a champion and fetches your owned skins from LCU
4. **Real-Time Skin Detection**: Uses advanced OCR to detect skin names as you hover over them during champion select
5. **Ownership Verification**: Automatically skips injection if you already own the detected skin
6. **Base Skin Forcing**: Forces base skin selection before injection (required for proper skin overlay)
7. **Automatic Injection**: Injects the last hovered unowned skin 500 milliseconds before game starts with CPU priority boost for reliability

**Performance & Reliability**:

- **Process Suspension**: Game process is suspended during injection to ensure reliable overlay installation
- **High-Priority Processing**: Uses CPU priority boost for mkoverlay and runoverlay processes
- **Safety Mechanisms**: 20-second auto-resume timeout prevents game from being stuck frozen
- **Smart Injection**: Only injects skins you don't own, verified against LCU inventory
- **Robust Fallbacks**: Multiple LCU endpoints ensure base skin forcing works reliably

**No manual intervention required - just launch the app and play!**

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Unified Game Monitor System

SkinCloner uses a **single, unified monitor** for game process management, eliminating race conditions and complexity:

**Monitor Lifecycle:**

1. **Start**: Monitor activates when injection begins
2. **Watch**: Continuously scans for `League of Legends.exe` process
3. **Suspend**: Immediately suspends game when found to freeze loading
4. **Hold**: Keeps game suspended during mkoverlay (skin preparation)
5. **Resume**: Releases game when runoverlay starts (allows game to load while overlay hooks in)
6. **Safety**: Auto-resumes after 20s if injection stalls (prevents permanent freeze)

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **No Race Conditions**: Single source of truth for game state
- ✅ **Reliable Timing**: Ensures injection completes before game finishes loading
- ✅ **Fail-Safe**: Multiple safety mechanisms prevent game from being stuck

### In-Memory State Management

All application state is stored in memory using a thread-safe `SharedState` dataclass:

- **Zero File I/O**: No reading/writing state files during operation
- **Faster Performance**: Eliminates disk access overhead
- **Thread-Safe**: Lock-protected shared state across 6 concurrent threads
- **Clean Architecture**: Centralized state management in `state/shared_state.py`

### Multi-Threaded Architecture

SkinCloner uses 6 specialized threads for optimal performance:

1. **Phase Thread**: Monitors LCU for game phase changes (lobby → champ select → in-game)
2. **Champion Thread**: Detects champion hover/lock and fetches owned skins from LCU
3. **OCR Thread**: High-frequency skin name detection using Tesseract OCR
4. **WebSocket Thread**: Real-time event handling via LCU WebSocket connection
5. **LCU Monitor Thread**: Maintains connection to League Client
6. **Loadout Ticker Thread**: Countdown timer for injection timing

All threads coordinate through the shared state system for seamless operation.
